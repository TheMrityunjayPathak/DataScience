📊 **What is Data Science?** 📊

- Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and techniques to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make business decisions. 

- Data science uses complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.

🎯 **Topics Covered in Repository**

[Python](https://www.kaggle.com/code/themrityunjaypathak/python-tutorial)🐍

- Python is open source, interpreted, high level language and provides great approach for object-oriented programming.

- It is one of the best language used by data scientist for various data science projects/application.

- Python provide great functionality to deal with mathematics, statistics and scientific function.

- It provides great libraries to deals with data science application.

📍 **Following are some useful features of Python language:**
 
- It uses the elegant syntax, hence the programs are easier to read.

- It is a simple to access language, which makes it easy to achieve the program working.

- The large standard library and community support.

- The interactive mode of Python makes its simple to test codes.

- In Python, it is also simple to extend the code by appending new modules that are implemented in other compiled language like C++ or C.

- Python is an expressive language which is possible to embed into applications to offer a programmable interface.

- Allows developer to run the code anywhere, including Windows, Mac OS X, UNIX, and Linux.

- It is free software in a couple of categories. It does not cost anything to use or download Pythons or to add it to the application.

[Numpy](https://www.kaggle.com/code/themrityunjaypathak/numpy-tutorial)📐

- NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.

- It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

- NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.

- NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

📍 **Why Use NumPy?**

- In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

- NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.

- The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.

- Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

[Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/code/themrityunjaypathak/pandas-tutorial)🐼

- Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.

- It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

📍 **Why Use Pandas?**

- Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.

- Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.

- Relevant data is very important in data science.

📍 **What Can Pandas Do?**

**Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like:**

- Is there a correlation between two or more columns?

- What is average value?

- Max value?

- Min value?

[Matplotlib](https://www.kaggle.com/code/themrityunjaypathak/matplotlib-tutorial)📊

- Matplotlib is a low level graph plotting library in python that serves as a visualization utility.

- Matplotlib was created by John D. Hunter.

- Matplotlib is open source and we can use it freely.

- Matplotlib is mostly written in python, a few segments are written in C, Objective-C and Javascript for Platform compatibility.

📍 **Matplotlib: Visualization with Python**

- Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

- Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.

- Create publication quality plots.

- Make interactive figures that can zoom, pan, update.

- Customize visual style and layout.

- Export to many file formats.

- Embed in JupyterLab and Graphical User Interfaces.

- Use a rich array of third-party packages built on Matplotlib.
