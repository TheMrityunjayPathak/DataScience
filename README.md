# Data Science Repository

- This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files for various data science topics using Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

- These notebooks serve as a resource for learning and practicing data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Notebooks

- `Python.ipynb`: This notebook covers the basics of Python programming language, including data types, variables, control flow, functions, and more.

- `NumPy.ipynb`: This notebook introduces NumPy, a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It covers topics such as creating arrays, performing array operations, indexing, slicing, and basic linear algebra operations.

- `Pandas.ipynb`: In this notebook, you will learn about Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library. It covers topics such as working with Series and DataFrames, data cleaning, filtering, grouping, merging, and basic data exploration.

- `MatPlotLib.ipynb`: This notebook explores the Matplotlib library for data visualization in Python. It covers plotting various types of charts, customizing plots, adding labels and annotations, and creating visualizations for data analysis.
