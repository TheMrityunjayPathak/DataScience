🎯 **What is Data Science?**

- Data Science is a combination of mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and computer science. 

- Data Science is collecting, analyzing and interpreting data to gather insights into the data that can help decision-makers make informed decisions.

🎯 **Importance of Data Science**

- Nowadays, organizations are overwhelmed with data. 

- Data Science will help in extracting meaningful insights from that by combining various methods, technology, and tools.

🎯 **Data Science – Prerequisites**

1️⃣ **Statistics**

Data science relies on statistics to capture and transform data patterns into usable evidence through the use of complex machine-learning techniques.

2️⃣ **Programming**

- Python, R, and SQL are the most common programming languages. 

- To successfully execute a data science project, it is important to instill some level of programming knowledge. 

3️⃣ **Machine Learning**

- Making accurate forecasts and estimates is made possible by Machine Learning, which is a crucial component of data science. 

- You must have a firm understanding of machine learning if you want to succeed in the field of data science.

4️⃣ **Databases**

A clear understanding of the functioning of Databases, and skills to manage and extract data is a must in this domain. 

5️⃣ **Modeling**

- You may quickly calculate and predict using mathematical models based on the data you already know. 

- Modeling helps in determining which algorithm is best suited to handle a certain issue and how to train these models.

🎯 **Data Science Process**

1️⃣ **Obtaining the data**

The first step is to identify what type of data needs to be analyzed, and this data needs to be exported to an excel or a CSV file.

2️⃣ **Cleaning the data**

It is essential because before you can read the data, you must ensure it is in a perfectly readable state, without any mistakes, with no missing or wrong values.

3️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis**

- Analyzing the data is done by visualizing the data in various ways and identifying patterns to spot anything out of the ordinary. 

- To analyze the data, you must have excellent attention to detail to identify if anything is out of place.

4️⃣ **Modeling or Machine Learning**

- A data engineer or scientist writes down instructions for the Machine Learning algorithm to follow based on the Data that has to be analyzed. 

- The algorithm iteratively uses these instructions to come up with the correct output.

5️⃣ **Interpreting the data**

In this step, you uncover your findings and present them to the organization. The most critical skill in this would be your ability to explain your results.
