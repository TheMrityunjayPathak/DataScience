👉 **What is Data Science?**

- Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and techniques to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make business decisions. 

- Data science uses complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.

📚 **Prerequisites for Data Science**

Here are some of the technical concepts you should know about before starting to learn what is data science.

1️⃣ **Machine Learning :** 

- Machine learning is the backbone of data science. 

- Data Scientists need to have a solid grasp of ML in addition to basic knowledge of statistics.

2️⃣ **Modeling :**

- Mathematical models enable you to make quick calculations and predictions based on what you already know about the data. 

- Modeling is also a part of Machine Learning and involves identifying which algorithm is the most suitable to solve a given problem and how to train these models.

3️⃣ **Statistics :** 

- Statistics are at the core of data science. 

- A good command on statistics can help you extract more meaningful results.

4️⃣ **Programming :** 

- Some level of programming is required to execute a successful data science project.

- The most common programming languages are Python, and R. 

- Python is especially popular because it’s easy to learn, and it supports multiple libraries for data science and ML.

5️⃣ **Databases :**

- A capable data scientist needs to understand how databases work, how to manage them, and how to extract data from them.
